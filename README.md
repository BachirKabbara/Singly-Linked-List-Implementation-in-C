# Singly Linked List Implementation in C

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a singly linked list in C. It demonstrates various operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, displaying, reversing, and sorting elements within the list. This project is aimed at showcasing fundamental data structure manipulation, memory management, and modular programming in C.

## Features
- Insertion at the beginning, at the end, and at a specified position in the list.
- Deletion from the beginning, the end, and a specified position.
- Displaying the entire list of elements.
- Searching for all occurrences of an element and reporting their positions.
- Getting the current length of the list.
- Reversing the list order.
- Sorting the list using insertion sort.

## How to Run
Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system (such as gcc). Compile the code using the following command:

gcc -o linkedlist linkedlist.c

Then, run the compiled program:

./linkedlist

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the linked list.

## Structure

- `Node`: A structure representing a node in the linked list.
- `newNode`: A function to create a new node.
- `insertAtBeginning`, `insertAtEnd`, `insertAtPosition`: Functions to insert new nodes.
- `deleteFromBeginning`, `deleteFromEnd`, `deleteFromPosition`: Functions to delete nodes.
- `displayList`: A function to display the list contents.
- `searchElement`: A function to search for an element in the list.
- `getLength`: A function to get the length of the list.
- `reverseList`: A function to reverse the list.
- `sortList`: A function to sort the list.
